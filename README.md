# Quarter 04 (Learning) - What is Generative AI?

## What is Generative AI?

Generative AI refers to a type of artificial intelligence that produces new content like text, images, audio, video, or computer code by learning patterns from existing data. By analyzing research papers, blog posts, industry reports, and media articles, we can build a strong understanding of its core mechanisms, applications, and implications.

## üß© Core Concepts of Generative AI

Generative AI systems use **machine learning models** to generate outputs resembling their training data. The process involves the following models:

1. **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):** 
   - Consists of two neural networks:
     - **Generator:** Creates content.
     - **Discriminator:** Evaluates the realism of content.
   - This setup improves the generator to produce increasingly realistic outputs.

2. **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs):**
   - Encodes data into a compressed format and then samples new outputs.

3. **Autoregressive Models (Transformers):**
   - These models predict the next token in a sequence to generate fluent text (e.g., GPT, LLaMA).

Generative AI learns data patterns, enabling it to create outputs that are **novel** but still consistent with its training data, like human-like text (ChatGPT), realistic images (DALL¬∑E), or synthetic audio.
